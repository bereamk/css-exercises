/* Only the p elements that are descendants of the 
div element should have a yellow background, red 
text, a font size of 20px, and center aligned. */


/* the first class is "container" (div), and the 
second class is "text" (p). Ancestors are id'd by
a simple space between the two classes.

First example with only class identifiers:

.container .text {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

Example of both class and id: */

#container .text {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

/* This could be done with id's in the same way
as long as the HTML has the elements listed as an
id 

Example: 
#container #text {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}
